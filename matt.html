		<h2>Interests and hobbies:</h2>
		
		<p>Above all, I'm a curious person.  My desire to learn and understand the world around me has lead me into many areas beyond my construction focused career:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Amateur radio. FCC General class license since 2015 with callsign Wâˆ…DVO.</li>
			<li>Welding and fabrication.  Have been interested in welding since I was a kid, and made a living with it for a while.</li>
			<li>Programming. I can't yet program <i>per se</i>, but can generally implement and modify others' code to do what I need to. Played with Python a bit, JS a tiny bit.</li>
			<li>Woodworking, mostly in a meta sense. I enjoy making things that make my workshop nicer to use.</li>
			<li>Anything tech related. I'm typically an early adopter. I've owned this domain for 13 years now and use it for my <sup><sub><sub>(grandfathered-in and still free)</sub></sub></sup> Google Workspace account through which I provide email and Google's other services to my family.</li>
			<li>Blacksmithing. Favorite project was making my stainless steel damascus <a href="/rings.jpg"style="text-decoration:none">wedding rings</a>.</li>
			<li>Electronics.</li>
			<li>Metrology.</li>
			<li>Leatherwork.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Skills</h2>
		
		<p>Software: Windows, Linux, MS Office, Bluebeam, CAD/BIM (AutoCAD, Revit, SolidEdge, Microstation, Fusion360, Vectorworks, QCAD), quick to pick up new tools.</p>
		
		<p>Physical world: Construction, metalworking, woodworking, electrical wiring, machining, building science, networking, building codes, FAA Certified Part 107 UAS Operator.</p>

		<h2>Personal projects relevant to IOT/monitoring:</h2>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Utility trailer temp monitor.</dt>
				<dd>Using an ESP8266, DHT22 temp sensor, and a couple relays, I built a temperature monitor for a utility trailer that needed to stay above 10&deg;C. In addition to transmitting temperature and humidity data to adafruit io for display on <a href=https://io.adafruit.com/divincentis/dashboards/trailer-temp?kiosk=true" style="text-decoration: none">a dashboard</a>, the system drives red and green <a href="/templights.gif"style="text-decoration:none">indicator lights</a> mounted outside the trailer to provide fast and intuitive visual indication of temperature status.  ESP code and relay logic is set up to indicate red in the event of a failure of any component in the sensor system.</dd>
			<dt>Well flow tester and data logger.</dt>
				<dd>My dad, who's a home inspector, needed a device to test and log water flow from residential wells. There are commercial solutions, but they're far too expensive for this application. As a rapid proof of concept, I created a <a href="/wellflowtest.jpg"style="text-decoration:none">logging device</a> using an inexpensive water meter, LogAlert for data acquisition, rechargable USB power, and a toolbox with 3d printed mounts.
				<br>
				Utimately I would like to automate the report generation using Python.  But for now, the data is exported from LogAlert and dumped into an Excel template which auto-adjusts for test duration and presents the data in a <a href="samplereport.jpg"style="text-decoration:none">usable format</a> for customers.  Pump current logging is another feature that is currently manually acquired and entered but I would like to automate this as well with a CT that the LogAlert can read and log.</dd>
